# TrckFnds

This repo is a humble attempt to build a portfolio tracking and analysis open source solution.

### Motivations

This project was built to both learn and create an app tailored to my personal needs. Some features & fix might be added from time to time but I'm currently not planning on actively pushing this app further for now.

### Project structure

The app is a pnpm workspace monorepo featuring:

- an `api` app which is an ExpressJS API
- a `front` app which is a NextJS frontend
- a `shared` package which contains constants and types used on both front & api sides

### Contributing

If you're willing to contribute, feel free to open a PR. I'll review it when I have time.
